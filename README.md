# Alcohol Consumption and Academic Performance Repository
## About
This is our Mini-Project for SC1015, where we focused on analyzing the relationship between alcohol consumption in students and their academic performance. A detailed walkthrough of our project can be viewed from our source code here :
## Problem Definition
* Are we able to predict the academic performance, measured by final grade, of a student based on the frequency of their alcohol consumption? <br>
* If not, are there any other factors within the dataset that are better suit for predicting the academic performance?
