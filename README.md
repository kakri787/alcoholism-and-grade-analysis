# Alcohol Consumption and Academic Performance Repository
## About
This is our Mini-Project for SC1015, where we focused on analyzing the relationship between alcohol consumption in students and their academic performance. A detailed walkthrough of our project can be viewed from our source code here :
## Problem Definition
* Are we able to predict the academic performance, measured by final grade, of a student based on the frequency of their alcohol consumption? <br>
* If not, are there any other factors within the dataset that are better suit for predicting the academic performance?

## Model Used
* Lasso Regression
* Neural Network Embedding
## Conclusion
* Alcohol consumption has a very low negative correlation with academic performance
* Alcohol consumption cannot be used as a predictor for student's grades
* Several other factors that contribute to a student's learning environment and background also have low correlation with academic performance
* The optimal combination of variables in our dataset is unable to predict student's grades accurately
* A student's decision to pursue higher education has the greatest correlation with their grades
* Neural Network Embedding model was able to predict grades with mean absolute error of around 20% which is still considerably high.
* Every student is unique and there is no standard baseline of a student's academic ability thus it is difficulty to predict student's grade

## What did we learn?
* Handling skewed data
* Lasso Regression
* Neural Network Embedding, Keras, Tensorflow
